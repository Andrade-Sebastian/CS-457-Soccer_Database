# CS-457-Soccer_Database
Soccer_Database for La Liga 2024
This is a database system that is used from the command line terminal. This system uses PostgreSQL and assumes that the tables with the correct attributes are created already.
How it works:
	- Fetches data from Football-API
	- Parses throught that data
	- Inputs that data into PostgreSQL database
	- Asks user whether they want to add or retrieve from database via command line input
